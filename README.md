# Personal Bash Profile Settings
Move `.bash_profile` to the `~/.bash_profile` directory. All other files, move to `$HOME/dev_tools` (or just adjust the directory in `.bash_profile`).

The most important thing I keep here is my aliases. My prompt coming in at a close second. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your bash profile and prompt.
